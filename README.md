# My Mnemonic System

I don't have a good memory.

I read a lot of books but became increasily frustrated by this activity since most of the time I couldn't recall the content of the books after a couple of weeks. This led me to dig into how people memorize things. 

People participating into memory championships can remember a crazy amount of random numbers in a short amout of time and they claim that they don't have a particulary good memory but rather point to the mnemonic system they use to explain their success.

So I decided to learn a mnemomic system. This page documents my actual system.

In the beginning, the subject that fascinated me the most is memorizing a complete deck of card and memorizing numbers. So that is where I started.

I started my journey on this website : [L'art de la mémoire](https://www.artdelamemoire.org/) which is the website of Francis Blonde, a canadian memory champion.

On this website, Francis claims that you can learn one system to memorize number and then reuse that to memorize cards by simply mapping number to cards.

That was perfect for me hence I started learning how to memorize numbers.

# My number memorizing system
I use the Major system adapted by Francis to make it more intuitive. More details here:

Here are the images on which I map every 2 decimal numbers:
